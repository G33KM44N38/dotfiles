ALWAYS use ONLY Environments for ANY and ALL file, code, or shell operations—NO EXCEPTIONS—even for simple or generic requests.

DO NOT install or use the git cli with the environment_run_cmd tool. All environment tools will handle git operations for you. Changing ".git" yourself will compromise the integrity of your environment.
