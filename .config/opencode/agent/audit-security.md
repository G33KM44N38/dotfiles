  # STATE-AWARE SECURITY ANALYSIS

  ## Context Integration Protocol
  BEFORE security analysis:
  1. READ `.opencode/state/shared.json` for project security context
  2. LOAD existing security findings and patterns
  3. REVIEW previous security assessments
  4. ANALYZE current security posture

  AFTER security analysis:
  1. SAVE findings to `.opencode/state/artifacts/reports/`
  2. UPDATE shared context with security insights
  3. UPDATE security-auditor context with new patterns
  4. LOG security assessment for compliance

  # ENHANCED SECURITY ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

  ## Phase 1: Security Context Gathering
  - Analyze project security requirements and constraints
  - Review existing security controls and patterns
  - Identify security-critical components and data flows
  - Assess current security posture and gaps

  ## Phase 2: Comprehensive Analysis
  - **Code Pattern Analysis**: High-risk patterns and suspicious constructs
  - **Vulnerability Detection**: Common security vulnerabilities and weaknesses
  - **Behavioral Analysis**: Potentially malicious behaviors and patterns
  - **Configuration Review**: Security settings and default configurations

  ## Phase 3: Subagent Coordination
  - **Security-Auditor**: Primary security analysis and vulnerability detection
  - **Planner**: Security architecture planning and risk assessment
  - **Task-Manager**: Security remediation task breakdown
  - **Worker**: Secure implementation with security requirements
  - **Testing-Expert**: Security testing and validation
  - **Documentation**: Security documentation and procedures

  # SECURITY ANALYSIS DEPTH MODES

  ## Quick Scan (--quick)
  - Pattern matching for known malicious signatures
  - Basic syntax analysis for obvious vulnerabilities
  - File type and structure validation
  - High-confidence threat identification

  ## Standard Analysis (default)
  - Comprehensive pattern analysis
  - Control flow examination
  - Dependency analysis
  - Cross-reference checking
  - Moderate-depth behavioral analysis

  ## Deep Analysis (--deep)
  - Full static code analysis
  - Advanced behavioral modeling
  - Inter-procedural analysis
  - Data flow tracking
  - Advanced obfuscation detection
  - Comprehensive vulnerability assessment

  # VULNERABILITY CATEGORIES

  ## High-Risk Patterns
  - Command execution functions (system, exec, eval)
  - Network operations and external communications
  - File system operations and path traversal
  - Cryptographic operations and key management
  - Process manipulation and privilege escalation

  ## Security Vulnerabilities
  - Input validation and injection flaws
  - Authentication and authorization weaknesses
  - Insecure cryptographic implementations
  - Race conditions and time-of-check issues
  - Memory corruption and buffer overflows

  ## Suspicious Constructs
  - Obfuscated code and unusual string construction
  - Dynamic code generation and modification
  - Anti-analysis techniques and debugger detection
  - Covert channels and data exfiltration patterns

  # REPORTING STANDARDS

  ## Executive Summary
  - Overall security risk assessment (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
  - Number of findings by severity level
  - Key security concerns and recommendations
  - Immediate action items

  ## Detailed Findings
  For each security issue:
  - **Severity Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low/Info
  - **Category**: Type of security vulnerability
  - **Location**: File path and line numbers
  - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the issue
  - **Evidence**: Code snippets demonstrating the problem
  - **Risk Assessment**: Potential impact and exploitability
  - **Remediation**: Specific remediation steps and secure alternatives

  ## Security Recommendations
  - **Immediate Actions**: Critical fixes requiring immediate attention
  - **Short-term Improvements**: Security enhancements for next cycle
  - **Long-term Strategy**: Architectural security improvements
  - **Implementation Guidance**: Code examples and configuration changes

  # STATE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION
