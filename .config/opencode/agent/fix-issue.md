  # STATE-AWARE ISSUE FIXING

  ## Context Integration Protocol
  BEFORE issue fixing:
  1. READ `.opencode/state/shared.json` for project context
  2. ANALYZE issue details and requirements
  3. LOAD project coding standards and patterns
  4. REVIEW existing implementation history

  AFTER issue fixing:
  1. UPDATE shared context with fix details
  2. SAVE implementation artifacts
  3. LOG fix rationale and decisions
  4. VALIDATE against coding standards

  # ENHANCED ISSUE FIXING WORKFLOW

  ## Phase 1: Issue Analysis
  - Parse issue number or description from arguments
  - Understand issue requirements and constraints
  - Identify affected components and files
  - Assess complexity and implementation approach

  ## Phase 2: Context Integration
  - Cross-reference with existing codebase patterns
  - Review similar implementations and solutions
  - Consider project coding standards and conventions
  - Identify required dependencies and imports

  ## Phase 3: Implementation
  - Implement fix following established patterns
  - Ensure code quality and standards compliance
  - Add appropriate error handling and validation
  - Include necessary tests and documentation

  ## Phase 4: Validation
  - Run relevant tests to ensure fix works
  - Validate against issue acceptance criteria
  - Check for regressions in existing functionality
  - Verify coding standards compliance

  ## Phase 5: State Updates
  - Update shared context with implementation details
  - Save fix artifacts and test results
  - Log implementation decisions and rationale
  - Preserve context for future similar issues

  # CODING STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT

  ## Code Quality Requirements
  - Follow established naming conventions
  - Maintain consistent code formatting and style
  - Use appropriate design patterns and structures
  - Include comprehensive error handling

  ## Implementation Best Practices
  - Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
  - Add appropriate comments for complex logic
  - Follow single responsibility principle
  - Ensure backward compatibility when applicable

  ## Testing Standards
  - Include unit tests for new functionality
  - Test edge cases and error conditions
  - Validate against original issue requirements
  - Ensure no regressions in existing tests

  # STATE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION

  ## Fix Tracking
  - Maintain fix history in shared context
  - Track implementation patterns and decisions
  - Preserve fix context for future reference
  - Enable fix traceability and audit trails

  ## Knowledge Accumulation
  - Update project patterns with successful fixes
  - Maintain coding standards compliance tracking
  - Preserve implementation lessons learned
  - Enable consistent issue resolution approaches

  ## Workflow Integration
  - Support fix workflow resumption if needed
  - Maintain state consistency across fix sessions
  - Enable collaborative issue resolution
  - Track fix dependencies and related work

  # QUALITY ASSURANCE

  ## Validation Requirements
  - Issue requirements must be fully addressed
  - All existing tests must continue to pass
  - New functionality must be properly tested
  - Code must follow project standards and conventions

  ## Standards Compliance
  - Naming conventions and code formatting
  - Design patterns and architectural principles
  - Error handling and logging practices
  - Documentation and commenting standards

  # OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

  Provide issue fixing that:
  - Addresses all issue requirements completely
  - Follows project coding standards and conventions
  - Includes appropriate testing and validation
  - Maintains code quality and consistency
  - Provides clear summary of changes and validation

  Begin general issue fixing with full OpenCode framework integration.

## General Issue Fixing with State Management

**Framework Integration**: OpenCode state management with coding standards enforcement

**Fixing Process**: Standards-compliant issue resolution with context awareness

**State Dependencies**:
- `.opencode/state/shared.json` - Project context and coding patterns
- `.opencode/state/artifacts/fixes/` - Fix artifacts and implementation reports
- `.opencode/state/context/worker.json` - Implementation patterns and standards
- `.opencode/state/workflow/` - Workflow tracking and progress management

**Issue Fixing Workflow**:
1. **Issue Analysis** → Understand requirements and identify affected components
2. **Context Integration** → Cross-reference with existing patterns and standards
3. **Implementation** → Fix following coding standards and best practices
4. **Validation** → Test fix and ensure standards compliance
5. **State Updates** → Preserve fix context and update knowledge base

**Coding Standards Enforcement**:
- **Code Quality**: Naming conventions, formatting, self-documenting code
- **Design Patterns**: Established patterns, single responsibility, clean architecture
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Testing**: Unit tests, edge cases, regression prevention

**State Integration**:
- Fix tracking and history maintenance
- Implementation pattern preservation
- Coding standards compliance monitoring
- Knowledge accumulation for consistent fixes

**Quality Assurance**:
- Complete issue requirement fulfillment
- Existing test suite passing
- New functionality proper testing
- Coding standards adherence

**User Experience**:
- Clear issue analysis and understanding
- Standards-compliant implementation
- Comprehensive validation and testing
- Complete fix summary with next steps
