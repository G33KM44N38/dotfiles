  # STATE-AWARE ISSUE RESOLUTION

  ## Context Integration Protocol
  BEFORE issue processing:
  1. READ `.opencode/state/shared.json` for project context
  2. FETCH issue details from GitHub API
  3. ANALYZE repository structure and codebase
  4. LOAD existing patterns and implementation history

  AFTER issue resolution:
  1. UPDATE shared context with resolution details
  2. SAVE implementation artifacts and reports
  3. LOG workflow history for audit trail
  4. UPDATE issue status and create PR if needed

  # COMPREHENSIVE ISSUE RESOLUTION WORKFLOW

  ## Phase 1: Issue Analysis & Validation
  - Parse GitHub issue URL or number from arguments
  - Fetch complete issue details (title, body, labels, state)
  - Validate issue exists and is open for resolution
  - Extract key requirements and acceptance criteria

  ## Phase 2: Repository & Codebase Analysis
  - Analyze current repository structure and technology stack
  - Identify relevant files based on issue description
  - Review existing code patterns and conventions
  - Check for related issues and previous implementations

  ## Phase 3: Implementation Planning
  Based on issue type:
  - **Bug Fixes**: Identify root cause and plan minimal fix
  - **Features**: Break down requirements and plan implementation
  - **Enhancements**: Assess current implementation and plan improvements
  - **Documentation**: Identify documentation gaps and update needs

  ## Phase 4: Orchestrated Implementation
  Use full subagent coordination:
  1. **Planner**: Generate strategic implementation plan
  2. **Task-Manager**: Break down into executable tasks
  3. **Worker**: Implement changes with full context
  4. **Testing-Expert**: Validate implementation and run tests
  5. **Security-Auditor**: Perform security analysis
  6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation

  ## Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Validation
  - Run comprehensive test suite
  - Perform security validation
  - Validate against issue acceptance criteria
  - Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

  ## Phase 6: Completion & Reporting
  - Create well-formatted commit with issue reference
  - Optionally create pull request with comprehensive description
  - Update issue status and add resolution details
  - Provide complete summary of changes and validation

  # ISSUE TYPE HANDLING

  ## Bug Fix Workflow
  - Reproduce the issue and identify root cause
  - Implement minimal fix addressing the core problem
  - Add regression tests to prevent future occurrences
  - Validate fix against all reported scenarios

  ## Feature Implementation
  - Break down feature requirements into implementable tasks
  - Implement core functionality following project patterns
  - Add comprehensive tests and documentation
  - Validate feature against acceptance criteria

  ## Enhancement Workflow
  - Assess current implementation and identify improvement areas
  - Plan incremental enhancements maintaining backward compatibility
  - Implement improvements with proper testing
  - Document changes and migration considerations

  # SUBAGENT COORDINATION

  ## Planner Integration
  - Analyze issue requirements and generate implementation strategy
  - Consider architectural implications and technical constraints
  - Provide guidance for task breakdown and implementation approach

  ## Task Manager Integration
  - Break down complex issues into manageable implementation tasks
  - Establish task dependencies and implementation order
  - Track progress and manage task completion

  ## Worker Integration
  - Execute implementation following established patterns
  - Maintain code quality and consistency with codebase
  - Implement security best practices and error handling

  ## Testing Expert Integration
  - Develop comprehensive test cases for the issue resolution
  - Execute test suites and validate implementation
  - Ensure no regressions and proper test coverage

  ## Security Auditor Integration
  - Perform security analysis on implemented changes
  - Identify potential security implications
  - Ensure secure coding practices are followed

  ## Documentation Integration
  - Update technical documentation for changes
  - Add usage examples and API documentation
  - Maintain changelog and release notes

  # QUALITY ASSURANCE STANDARDS

  ## Validation Requirements
  - Issue acceptance criteria must be met
  - All existing tests must pass
  - New functionality must be properly tested
  - Security analysis must pass without critical issues
  - Documentation must be updated and accurate

  ## Testing Standards
  - Unit tests for new functionality
  - Integration tests for feature validation
  - Regression tests to prevent future issues
  - Performance and security testing as applicable

  # STATE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION

  ## Issue Tracking
  - Maintain issue resolution history in shared context
  - Track implementation progress and decisions
  - Preserve issue context for future reference
  - Enable issue traceability and audit trails

  ## Workflow Continuity
  - Support workflow resumption for complex issues
  - Maintain state across implementation sessions
  - Enable collaborative issue resolution
  - Track dependencies and related work

  ## Artifact Preservation
  - Save implementation reports and test results
  - Maintain code change history and rationale
  - Preserve documentation updates and decisions
  - Enable knowledge accumulation for similar issues

  # OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

  Provide comprehensive issue resolution that:
  - Addresses all issue requirements and acceptance criteria
  - Implements changes following project patterns and standards
  - Includes comprehensive testing and validation
  - Updates documentation and maintains knowledge base
  - Provides clear summary of changes and next steps
