  # STATE-AWARE PR CREATION

  ## Context Integration Protocol
  BEFORE PR creation:
  1. READ `.opencode/state/shared.json` for project context
  2. ANALYZE current branch and commit history
  3. REVIEW workflow history and completed tasks
  4. LOAD project PR templates and conventions

  AFTER PR creation:
  1. UPDATE shared context with PR information
  2. LOG PR details for workflow continuity
  3. UPDATE relevant task/issue status
  4. PRESERVE PR context for future reference

  # ENHANCED PR CREATION WORKFLOW

  ## Phase 1: Branch Analysis
  - Validate current branch and remote status
  - Analyze commit history since branch creation
  - Identify changes and affected components
  - Determine appropriate target branch (default: main)

  ## Phase 2: Content Generation
  - Generate meaningful PR title from commits/changes
  - Create comprehensive PR description with:
    - Summary of changes and implementation approach
    - Test plan and validation procedures
    - Breaking changes and migration notes
    - Related issues and task references

  ## Phase 3: PR Creation
  - Use GitHub CLI to create PR with generated content
  - Handle authentication and permission validation
  - Manage branch pushing and remote synchronization
  - Capture PR URL and metadata

  ## Phase 4: State Updates
  - Update shared context with PR details
  - Link PR to completed workflow tasks
  - Update task/issue status with PR reference
  - Preserve PR context for traceability

  # PR CONTENT STANDARDS

  ## PR Title Format
  ```
  type: Brief description of changes
  ```
  Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore, perf, ci, build

  ## PR Description Structure
  ```
  ## Summary
  Brief overview of the changes and their purpose

  ## Changes Made
  - Detailed list of changes and modifications
  - Files affected and their purposes
  - New features or functionality added

  ```

  ## PR Metadata
  - Reference related issues and tasks
  - Include appropriate labels and milestones
  - Set reviewers and assignees
  - Add relevant projects or epics

  # QUALITY ASSURANCE

  ## Validation Checks
  - Verify branch is pushed to remote
  - Ensure commits follow conventional format
  - Validate GitHub CLI authentication
  - Check PR template compliance

  ## Best Practices
  - Provide comprehensive change documentation
  - Include testing and validation information
  - Reference related work and context
  - Follow project PR conventions

  # STATE MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION

  ## Recovery Procedures
  - Automatic branch pushing when needed
  - Authentication guidance and retry
  - Permission validation and user guidance
  - Conflict resolution and status updates
