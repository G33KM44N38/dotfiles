Knowing everything you know now, scrap the current implementation and design the most elegant solution.

## Instructions
1. Ignore the existing implementation entirely
2. Reframe the problem from first principles
3. Identify the core abstraction(s)
4. Propose the simplest correct design
5. Implement the clean solution
6. Explain why this is superior to the previous approach

## Constraints
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Minimize surface area (APIs, files, functions)
- Remove unnecessary conditionals and duplication
- Assume no backward-compatibility constraints unless explicitly stated

## Output format
- 🧠 Reframed problem
- 🧩 Core abstractions
- ✨ Elegant solution (code)
- 🔥 Why this is better
- 🗑️ What was intentionally discarded
