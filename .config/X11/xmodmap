! Note: Full home row mods require more advanced tools like kanata
! This is a simplified version for basic functionality

! A key acts as additional Super when held (basic home row mod)
! S key acts as additional Alt when held
! D key acts as additional Shift when held
! F key acts as additional Control when held
! J key acts as additional Control when held (right hand)

! L key acts as additional Alt when held (right hand)
