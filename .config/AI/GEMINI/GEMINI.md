For all the work you have to do ask me to create a PRD


when you finish a task or need my prompt run this command which is in the path ai_success.sh
 
when I ask you to create a PRD, follow this steps:

1. first create the PRD using ./.gemini/rules/create-prd.md
2. then generate the task list using ./.gemini/rules/generate-tasks.md
3. then process the task list using ./.gemini/rules/process-tasks.md
