Please, in order to prepare a clean commit, remove any logs, unnecessary files, and all debug code that you may have added during this development. If we discussed extensively and implemented a really amazing solution, create a small .md file in /docs to explain the solution. Only add this documentation if it's truly necessary for simple understanding of the project later.
Once you've done all that, you can listen to my clarifications if there are any:
"$ARGUMENTS."

And if there are none, you can commit.
