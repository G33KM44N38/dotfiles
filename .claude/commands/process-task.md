# Process Task Command

**Command:** `process-task`  
**Description:** Enhanced task list management system for tracking and completing PRD implementation tasks in markdown files  
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Usage:** `process-task [task-file.md] [options]`

## Overview

This command provides a structured approach to managing task lists in markdown files, specifically designed for tracking progress on Product Requirements Document (PRD) implementation. It enforces a disciplined workflow of completing one sub-task at a time while maintaining clear progress tracking.

## additionnal features

IMPORTANT: always see if there is an agent for the task you working on.

## Core Principles

### 1. Sequential Task Processing
- **One Sub-task Rule:** Complete only ONE sub-task per interaction cycle
- **Permission Protocol:** Always ask for explicit permission before proceeding to the next sub-task
- **Progress Validation:** Verify completion of current sub-task before moving forward
- **Context Preservation:** Maintain awareness of overall project context while focusing on individual tasks

### 2. Task State Management
- **Clear Status Indicators:** Use consistent markdown formatting for task states
- **Progress Tracking:** Maintain completion timestamps and progress notes
- **Dependency Awareness:** Identify and respect task dependencies
- **Quality Gates:** Ensure each completed task meets acceptance criteria

## Task Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Task Analysis
1. **Load Task File:** Read and parse the target markdown task file
2. **Status Assessment:** Identify current progress state and pending tasks
3. **Priority Evaluation:** Determine next logical task based on dependencies and priority
4. **Context Review:** Ensure understanding of overall project goals and constraints

### Phase 2: Task Execution
1. **Task Selection:** Choose the next actionable sub-task
2. **Scope Confirmation:** Clearly define what will be accomplished
3. **Implementation:** Execute the specific sub-task with full focus
4. **Validation:** Verify completion against acceptance criteria
5. **Documentation:** Update task status and add completion notes

### Phase 3: Progress Management
1. **Status Update:** Mark completed task with timestamp and notes
2. **Next Task Identification:** Identify the logical next step
3. **Permission Request:** Ask for explicit approval to continue
4. **Context Handoff:** Provide clear summary for next interaction

## Task List Format Standards

### Basic Task Structure
```markdown
## Task List: [Project/Feature Name]

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]
- [ ] **Task 1:** Description of first task
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.1: Specific actionable item
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.2: Another specific item
  - [ ] Sub-task 1.3: Final item in this task
- [ ] **Task 2:** Description of second task
  - [ ] Sub-task 2.1: Specific actionable item

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]
- [ ] **Task 3:** Description of third task
```

### Enhanced Task Structure with Metadata
```markdown
## Task List: [Project/Feature Name]
**Status:** In Progress | **Priority:** High | **Deadline:** 2024-XX-XX

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
**Status:** Completed ‚úÖ | **Completed:** 2024-XX-XX
- [x] **Task 1:** Database schema design
  - [x] Sub-task 1.1: Define user entity structure *(Completed: 2024-XX-XX)*
  - [x] Sub-task 1.2: Create migration files *(Completed: 2024-XX-XX)*
  - [x] Sub-task 1.3: Add validation rules *(Completed: 2024-XX-XX)*

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
**Status:** In Progress üöß | **Started:** 2024-XX-XX
- [ ] **Task 2:** User authentication system
  - [x] Sub-task 2.1: Implement login endpoint *(Completed: 2024-XX-XX)*
  - [~] Sub-task 2.2: Add password hashing *(Current Focus)*

```

## Status Indicators Reference

### Task States
- `[ ]` - Pending/Not Started
- `[x]` - Completed
- `[~]` - In Progress (current focus)
- `[-]` - Blocked/On Hold
- `[!]` - Needs Review/Attention

### Progress Symbols
- ‚úÖ **Completed** - Phase or major task finished
- üöß **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused** - Temporarily halted
- üö´ **Blocked** - Cannot proceed due to dependency
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **At Risk** - May miss deadline or has issues
- üìã **Planned** - Scheduled for future work

## AI Assistant Instructions

### Primary Directives
1. **Single Task Focus:** Only work on ONE sub-task per interaction
2. **Permission Protocol:** Always request permission before proceeding to next sub-task
3. **Status Maintenance:** Keep task list current with accurate progress indicators
4. **Context Awareness:** Understand project goals while maintaining task-level focus

### Interaction Pattern
```
1. ANALYZE: Review current task list state
2. IDENTIFY: Select next actionable sub-task
3. CONFIRM: State what will be accomplished
4. EXECUTE: Complete the specific sub-task
5. UPDATE: Mark task complete with timestamp
6. REQUEST: Ask permission to continue with next sub-task
```

### Communication Templates

#### Starting a Task Session
```
Task Analysis Complete:
- Current Phase: [Phase Name]
- Next Sub-task: [Sub-task Description]
- Estimated Effort: [Time/Complexity]
- Dependencies: [Any prerequisites]

Ready to proceed with: [Specific sub-task]
Shall I begin implementation?
```

#### Completing a Sub-task
```
Sub-task Completed: [Sub-task Name]
- Implementation: [Brief description of what was done]
- Files Modified: [List of changed files]
- Status: ‚úÖ Complete
- Timestamp: [Current date/time]
