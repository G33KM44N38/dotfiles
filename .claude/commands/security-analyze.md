## Security Analysis Protocol

### 1. Initial Assessment
- **Scope Identification**: Determine what type of analysis is needed (code review, task evaluation, architecture assessment)
- **Asset Classification**: Identify sensitive data, critical functions, and trust boundaries
- **Threat Surface Mapping**: Document potential attack vectors and entry points

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis
Examine for common security vulnerabilities:
- **Input Validation**: Check for injection flaws (SQL, XSS, command injection, path traversal)
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Verify proper access controls and session management
- **Data Protection**: Assess encryption, hashing, and sensitive data handling
- **Configuration Security**: Review security headers, CORS policies, and default configurations
- **Dependency Management**: Check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries
- **Error Handling**: Ensure no sensitive information leakage in error messages

### 3. Security Best Practices Review
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Verify minimal necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Check for multiple security layers
- **Secure by Default**: Assess default security configurations
- **Input Sanitization**: Verify proper data validation and sanitization
- **Output Encoding**: Check for proper encoding to prevent injection attacks
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Review security event logging and monitoring capabilities

### 4. Risk Assessment Framework
For each identified issue, provide:
- **Risk Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low based on exploitability and impact
- **Impact Analysis**: Potential consequences of successful exploitation
- **Exploitability**: How easily the vulnerability could be exploited
- **Business Risk**: Impact on business operations and data integrity

### 5. Security Recommendations
Provide actionable recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions**: Critical fixes that should be implemented immediately
- **Short-term Improvements**: Security enhancements for the next development cycle
- **Long-term Strategy**: Architectural improvements for better security posture
- **Implementation Guidance**: Specific code examples and configuration changes

### 6. Defensive Security Patterns
Recommend appropriate security patterns:
- **Input Validation Patterns**: Whitelist validation, regex patterns, type checking
- **Authentication Patterns**: Multi-factor authentication, secure session management
- **Authorization Patterns**: Role-based access control, attribute-based access control
- **Data Protection Patterns**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure key management
- **Monitoring Patterns**: Security event logging, anomaly detection, audit trails

### 7. Security Testing Recommendations
- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning tools and techniques
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime security testing approaches
- **Penetration Testing**: Recommended testing scenarios
- **Security Code Review**: Manual review checklist
